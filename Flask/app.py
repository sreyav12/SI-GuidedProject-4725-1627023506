The trick is to first slice the potatoes and then cut them lengthwise. You can also use a fries cutter for that long, even shape.",
    "Now, wash the potatoes under running water till they are squeaky clean. Place them in a bowl of iced water for 10 to 15 minutes. Keep them submerged in water or they will turn black.",
    "Now, heat the oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the smoke starts appearing, reduce the flame and allow it to acquire a lower temperature. Now, deep fry the potatoes in batches. Keep the flame low. This will make them crunchy and also help retain their colour.",

On the other hand, take a little warm water and mix the yeast in it along with 1 teaspoon of sugar. Mix well and keep aside for 10-15 minutes. The yeast will rise in the meantime. Once the yeast has risen, add it to the flour knead the dough nicely using some water. Keep this dough aside for 4-6 hours. Then knead the dough once again. Now, the pizza dough is ready.",
        "Preheat the oven at 180 degree Celsius. Now, is the time to make the pizza base when the dough is ready. Dust the space a little using dry flour and take a large amount of the pizza dough. Using a rolling pin, roll this dough into a nice circular base. (Note: Make sure that the circular base is even at all ends.) Once you have made the base, use a fork and prick the base with it so that the base doesn't rise and gets baked nicely. Put it into the preheated oven and bake it 10 minutes. Now, your pizza base is ready.",
        "Now, wash the capsicum and slice it thinly in a bowl. Then, peel the onions and cut thin slices of it as well in another bowl. And finally, cut tomatoes and mushrooms in the same manner. However, make sure that those tomatoes have less juice in them. Once all the veggies are done, Now, grate the processed and mozzarella cheese in separate bowls.",

Saute for a minute and then add chopped cashews and raisins, peanuts if you like them, boiled and mashed potatoes, cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, red chilli powder, salt to taste, kasoori methi leaves, coriander leaves. Mix well and saute for 2 minutes. Your stuffing is ready!",

Ensure that you add water gradually and make a firm dough. A soft dough will not make your samosas crispy. Cover the dough with a damp muslin cloth and keep aside for about half an hour.",
        "Once done, roll out few small-sized balls from the dough. Flatten them further with the help of your palms and then with a rolling pin. Give them a round shape and cut in half. Now dip your hands in water, fold the edges of the semi-circle in order to give it a cone shape.",
